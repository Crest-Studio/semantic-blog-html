          <h3>US President Donald Trump warned Tuesday of unspecified “very strong action” if Iranian authorities go ahead with threatened hangings of some protesters, with Tehran calling American warnings a “pretext for military intervention”.</h3>

          <p>International outrage has built over the crackdown that a rights group claimed, without evidence, has likely killed thousands during protests posing one of the biggest challenges yet to Iran’s clerical leadership.</p>
          
          <p>Iran’s UN mission posted a statement on X, vowing that Washington’s “playbook” would “fail again”.</p>
          
          <p>“US fantasies and policy toward Iran are rooted in regime change, with sanctions, threats, engineered unrest, and chaos serving as the modus operandi to manufacture a pretext for military intervention,” the post said.</p>

          <h3>‘Rising casualties’</h3>
          <p>European nations also signalled their anger over the crackdown, with France, Germany and the United Kingdom among the countries that summoned their Iranian ambassadors, as did the European Union.</p>

          <p>“The rising number of casualties in Iran is horrifying,” said EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, vowing further sanctions against those responsible.</p>

          <p>Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies.</p>

          <h3>’Serious challenge</h3>
          <p>The government on Monday sought to regain control of the streets with mass nationwide rallies that supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed as proof that the protest movement was defeated, calling them a “warning” to the United States.</p>

          <p>In power since 1989 and now aged 86, Khamenei has faced significant challenges, most recently the 12-day war in June against Israel, which resulted in the killing of top security officials and forced him to go into hiding.</p>

          <p>Analysts have cautioned that it is premature to predict the immediate demise of the theocratic system, pointing to the repressive levers the leadership controls, including the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is charged with safeguarding the Islamic revolution.</p>
